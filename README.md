# OpenCode Skills Plugin

Bring Anthropic's Agent Skills Specification (v1.0) to OpenCode. This plugin automatically discovers and registers skills as dynamic tools, enabling the Agent to leverage specialized knowledge, workflows, and bundled resources.

## Features

- âœ… **Auto-discovery** - Scans `.opencode/skills/` and `~/.opencode/skills/` recursively
- âœ… **Spec compliance** - Validates against Anthropic's Skills Specification v1.0
- âœ… **Dynamic tools** - Each skill becomes a `skills_{{name}}` tool
- âœ… **Path resolution** - Clear instructions for relative file paths
- âœ… **Nested skills** - Supports hierarchical skill organization
- âœ… **Task planning** - Integrates with OpenCode's todo system
- âœ… **Graceful errors** - Invalid skills skipped with helpful messages

## Installation

**No npm install needed!** OpenCode automatically installs plugins when you add them to your config.

Add to your `opencode.json` or `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json`:

```json
{
  "plugin": ["opencode-skills"]
}
```

OpenCode will auto-install the plugin on next startup.

## Quick Start

### 1. Create a Skill

Create a skill directory with a `SKILL.md` file:

```bash
mkdir -p .opencode/skills/my-skill
```

**`.opencode/skills/my-skill/SKILL.md`:**

```markdown
---
name: my-skill
description: A custom skill that helps with specific tasks in my project
license: MIT
---

# My Custom Skill

This skill helps you accomplish specific tasks.

## Instructions

1. First, do this
2. Then, do that
3. Finally, verify the results

You can reference supporting files like `scripts/helper.py` or `references/docs.md`.
```

### 2. Restart OpenCode

The plugin will discover and register your skill:

```
ðŸŽ¯ Skills Plugin: Starting discovery...
âœ… Found 1 skill(s): ['my-skill']
âœ… Registered 1 skill tool(s)
```

### 3. Use the Skill

Simply invoke the skill tool:

```
skills_my_skill
```

The Agent will:

1. Create a todo list of tasks from the skill
2. Execute the skill instructions
3. Track progress through the todo list

## Skill Structure

### Required: SKILL.md

Every skill must have a `SKILL.md` file with YAML frontmatter:

```markdown
---
name: skill-name # Must match directory name
description: What this skill does and when to use it (min 20 chars)
license: MIT # Optional
allowed-tools: # Optional (parsed but not enforced)
  - read
  - write
metadata: # Optional key-value pairs
  version: "1.0"
---

# Skill Content

Your skill instructions in Markdown format.
```

### Optional: Supporting Files

```
my-skill/
â”œâ”€â”€ SKILL.md              # Required
â”œâ”€â”€ scripts/              # Executable code
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ helper.py
â”œâ”€â”€ references/           # Documentation to load as needed
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ api-docs.md
â””â”€â”€ assets/               # Files used in output
    â””â”€â”€ template.html
```

## Skill Naming

| Directory           | Frontmatter Name   | Tool Name                 |
| ------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------- |
| `brand-guidelines/` | `brand-guidelines` | `skills_brand_guidelines` |
| `tools/analyzer/`   | `analyzer`         | `skills_tools_analyzer`   |

**Rules:**

- Directory name: lowercase with hyphens (`my-skill`)
- Frontmatter `name`: must match directory name exactly
- Tool name: auto-generated with underscores (`skills_my_skill`)

## Path Resolution

When a skill references files with relative paths:

```markdown
Read the API documentation in `references/api.md`.
Run the deployment script at `scripts/deploy.sh`.
```

The plugin provides clear path resolution instructions:

```
**SKILL DIRECTORY:** /path/to/.opencode/skills/my-skill/

If the skill mentions `references/api.md`, the full path is:
/path/to/.opencode/skills/my-skill/references/api.md
```

The Agent automatically understands and resolves these paths correctly.

## Global Skills

Skills in `~/.opencode/skills/` or `~/.config/opencode/skills/` are available across **all** projects:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.opencode/skills/personal-notes
# or
mkdir -p ~/.config/opencode/skills/personal-notes
# Create SKILL.md...
```

This skill will be available in every OpenCode project.

## Execution Workflow

When the Agent invokes a skill tool, it receives structured instructions:

1. **STEP 1: PLAN THE WORK**
   - Use `todowrite` to create task list
   - Identify all steps from skill content
   - Set appropriate priorities

2. **STEP 2: EXECUTE THE SKILL**
   - Follow skill instructions
   - Mark todos as `in_progress` and `completed`
   - Track progress through completion

This ensures systematic execution and nothing gets missed.

## Examples

Check out these [example](https://github.com/anthropics/skills) skills from Anthropic repository:

## Troubleshooting

**Skills not discovered?**

- Check console for `ðŸŽ¯ Skills Plugin: Starting discovery...`
- Verify `SKILL.md` files exist in `.opencode/skills/`
- Check frontmatter validation errors in console

**Tool not appearing?**

- Ensure `name` field matches directory name exactly
- Check for duplicate tool names (logged as warnings)
- Restart OpenCode after adding/modifying skills

**Paths not resolving?**

- Check the SKILL DIRECTORY shown in skill output
- Verify supporting files exist at specified paths
- Ensure paths in SKILL.md are relative (not absolute)

**Invalid skill errors?**

- Name must be lowercase with hyphens only (`[a-z0-9-]+`)
- Description must be at least 20 characters
- Name in frontmatter must match directory name

## Design Decisions

### Agent-Level Tool Restrictions

Tool restrictions are handled at the OpenCode agent level (via `opencode.json` or agent frontmatter), not at the skill level. This provides:

- Clearer permission model
- Simpler architecture
- Better alignment with OpenCode's existing system

Skills parse `allowed-tools` from frontmatter for spec compliance, but enforcement happens at the agent level.

### No Hot Reload

Skills are treated as project configuration, not runtime state. Adding or modifying skills requires restarting OpenCode. This is acceptable because:

- Skills change infrequently
- No API exists for runtime tool registration
- Simpler implementation

## API Reference

### Plugin Export

```typescript
export const SkillsPlugin: Plugin;
```

The plugin automatically:

1. Scans for `**/SKILL.md` files in discovery paths (`.opencode/skills/`, `~/.opencode/skills/`, `~/.config/opencode/skills/`)
2. Validates YAML frontmatter against spec
3. Registers a tool for each valid skill
4. Returns skill content with execution instructions

### Skill Interface

```typescript
interface Skill {
  name: string; // From frontmatter
  fullPath: string; // Absolute path to skill directory
  toolName: string; // Generated tool name
  description: string; // From frontmatter
  allowedTools?: string[]; // Parsed but not enforced
  metadata?: Record<string, string>;
  license?: string;
  content: string; // Markdown body
  path: string; // Absolute path to SKILL.md
}
```
