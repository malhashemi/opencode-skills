```

**Commit types:**
- `feat:` - New feature (triggers minor version bump)

- `docs:` - Documentation changes only
- `chore:` - Maintenance tasks (no version bump)
- `refactor:` - Code refactoring
- `test:` - Adding or updating tests
- `perf:` - Performance improvements

**Breaking changes:**

## Commit Message Guidelines

We follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) specification.

### Format

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

### Types

- **feat**: New feature
- **fix**: Bug fix
- **docs**: Documentation only changes
- **style**: Code style changes (formatting, missing semicolons, etc.)
- **refactor**: Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- **perf**: Performance improvements
- **test**: Adding or updating tests
- **chore**: Changes to build process or auxiliary tools

### Examples

```bash
# Simple feature
feat: add support for nested skill directories

# Bug fix with scope
fix(parser): handle empty frontmatter correctly

# Breaking change
feat!: require Node.js 20+

BREAKING CHANGE: Drops support for Node.js 18 and below
```

### Why Conventional Commits?

- **Automated versioning** - Commit messages determine version bumps
- **Automated changelog** - Release notes are generated automatically
- **Clear history** - Easy to understand what changed and why

## Code Style

### TypeScript

- Use TypeScript for all code
- Avoid `any` types - use proper type definitions
- Export types for public APIs
- Add JSDoc comments for public functions/interfaces

### Formatting

- The project uses existing TypeScript compiler settings
- Follow the patterns in existing code
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Keep functions focused and single-purpose

### File Organization
